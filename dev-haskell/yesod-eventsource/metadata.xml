		It&#39;s easy to send an event from an HTTP client to a server:
		just send an HTTP request.  However, sending events from the
		server to the client requires more sophisticated approaches.
		Server-sent events (&lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/&gt;) are a
		standardized way of pushing events from the server to the
		client.
		
		This package allows your Yesod application to easily send
		server-sent events.  On the client side, you may use the
		@EventSource@ JavaScript object on browsers that support it
		(&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/EventSource&gt;)
		or a polyfill for browsers that don&#39;t (we support Remy&#39;s
		polyfill out-of-the-box, although that requires you to
		explicitly support it).
