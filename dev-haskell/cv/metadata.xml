		This is a machine vision package that wraps some functionality
		of OpenCV library. This package has been developed for personal use and
		is not meant to be a complete wrapper. It also includes some things not
		in OpenCV.
		
		Currently this package is quite dirty and requires much work on documentation
		and code clean-up, but is somewhat tested.
		
		(The scarce) Documentation is available at
		&lt;http://aleator.github.com/CV/&gt;
		
		Changelog.
		0.3.6.0 - Critical referential transparency bug fix.
		
		0.3.5.4 - Bug fixes and preliminary compatability with opencv 2.4
		
		0.3.5 - Many new wrappers, clean ups and other fixes.
		
		0.3.4 - Pixelwise operations, bug fixes and additional documentation
		
		0.3.3.0 - Improvements, including compatablity with opencv 2.3.1 and removal of
		dependency with deprecated JYU.Utils
		
		Changelog.
		0.3.2.0 - Improvements, including fancier pixel-wise manipulations
		
		Changelog.
		0.3.0.2 - Workaround for compiling with OS X 10.6 &amp; fixed errors about M_PI
